                    <ul className="list-unstyled" >
                        <li className='' >The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not limited to cancellation and refund policies.</li>
                        <li>Travelocare merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.</li>
                        <li>Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior intimation to Travelocare. As a facilitator, Travelocare has no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.</li>
                        <li>Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services and price.</li>
                        <li>The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by the airline, and Travelocare has no role to play in the same. Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are “hand baggage fares” which do not entitle the User for free check-in baggage and therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check-in baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the airlines for detailed costs.</li>

                    <h2 className="sub-heading">CODE SHARE</h2>
                    <ul className="list-unstyled">
                        <li>Some airlines enter into &quot;code share&quot; agreements with other Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as &quot;operated by&quot; in the booking flow.</li>
                        <li>If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to payment.</li>
                        <li>Travelocare will disclose any such code-share arrangements to the User, only when the ticketing airline discloses it to Travelocare in the first place.</li>

Users are required to pay the entire amount prior to the confirmation of their booking(s). In the event the User does not pay the entire amount, Travelocare reserves its right to cancel the booking. User agrees to pay all statutory taxes, surcharges and fees, as applicable on the date of travel.</li>
                        <li>To avail infant fares, the age of the child must be under 24 months throughout the entire itinerary. This includes both onward and return journeys. If the infant is 24 months or above on the return journey, User will be required to make a separate booking using a child fare. Any infants or children must be accompanied by an adult as per the terms of the airlines.</li>
